Pointers to Member Functions in C++
Pointers to member functions are special pointers that point to member functions of a class (not standalone functions). They're different from regular function pointers because they need to be called in the context of a class object.

Key Concepts:
Syntax: Different from regular function pointers

Need an object: You need an object to call the member function through the pointer

Two ways to call: Using the .* or ->* operators
